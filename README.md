We were a team of 4 from the Masai Web-15 batch. We worked on creating REST API and writing business logic for an E-commerce application. Our project performs fundamental operations of an e-commerce website, where our customer's data is validated, mapped, processed with business logic & persisted in the database.

Amazon is one of the most popular online marketplaces used by both individual as well as businesses, and the site is available in many different countries and languages. Amazon was begun in 1994 in Seattle Washington by Jeff Bezos, and was initially little more than an online bookstore. From those humble beginnings, Amazon has become the largest online ecommerce retailer, and one of the most powerful brands in the world.
